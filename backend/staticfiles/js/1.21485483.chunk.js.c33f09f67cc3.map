Decided to keep it simple for the first few\n          versions, but eventually updated to using React for the frontend and using Django only for a backend REST API.

Second, the documentation on\n          Django is extensive, so virtually any problem I came accross was\n          solvable by reading through APIs and forums.\n        </p>\n\t  <p>\n\t  It is possible that React was a bit overkill for such a simple site, but I wanted to get experience with it before starting bigger projects, so I figured this was the best place to start.\n\t  </p>\n        <h1>Things I Learned</h1>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p>Web Dev is Fun!</p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>Basics of React and deploying static files for React using the whitenoise python module</p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>How to use Ubuntu from terminal to setup web server</p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>Managing asymmetric RSA keys for SSH access</p>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ProjectDetailView;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
