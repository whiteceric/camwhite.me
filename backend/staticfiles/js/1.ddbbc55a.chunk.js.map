Decided to keep it simple for the first few\n          versions, but there are more features to come. Web development is not\n          something I saw myself doing before this, but having really enjoyed\n          this project I definitely plan to do more of it.\n        </p>\n        <h1>Technology</h1>\n        <p>\n          I went with the Django framework for two main reasons: First I know\n          and love Python, making learning web development that much easier\n          because I was using a familiar language. Second, the documentation on\n          Django is extensive, so virtually any problem I came accross was\n          solvable by reading through APIs and forums. At first I wanted to use\n          the project to learn Javascript, but decided that it was not necessary\n          for such a simple site. So, the front end is almost plain HTML, with\n          Django working in the background providing some context variables. For\n          CSS, I wrote I few custom classes and referenced Bootstrap.\n        </p>\n        <h1>Things I Learned</h1>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p>Web Dev is Fun!</p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>How to use Ubuntu from terminal to setup web server</p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>Managing asymmetric RSA keys for SSH access</p>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ProjectDetailView;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
