<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
The theme of this project is change.
</p>
<p>
To start my modile development journey, I came up with an idea that involved my interest in financial markets and education. Looking at some of the dummy portfolios out there I noticed there are few mobile apps for them and the ones that do exist are overly complicated. I wanted to make something that a total beginner could use and understand. 
</p>

<h1>Technology</h1>

<p>
I started this project using the Kivy framework for app development in Python (I really like Python). Using Kivy I finished a Beta that was usable on desktop, but Kivy deployment is whole different story-deploying to iOS was very difficult for a few reasons, primarily the lack of support for the new line of M1 Mac computers. With that, I decided to migrate to Xcode and redo the app in Swift. That part is still ongoing, but a testable Beta should be up within a couple weeks.

<p>
For financial market data, I started with an <a href="https://iexcloud.io/">IEXCloud API</a>, using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/iexfinance/">iexfinance</a> Python module as a wrapper. This worked really well, except I later realized that the API calls I would make were a little out of my price range. With that, I moved to webscraping Yahoo Finance, which worked like a charm. With the move to Swift, I will have to re-write this part of project, but a solution that uses my Python code for webscraping would be nice (and easier to port to Android later on) so if you have suggestions, please <a href="/contact">email</a> me!
