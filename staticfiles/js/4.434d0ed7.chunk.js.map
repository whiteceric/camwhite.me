Looking at\n          some of the dummy portfolios out there I noticed there are few mobile\n          apps for them and the ones that do exist are overly complicated. I\n          wanted to make something that a total beginner could use and\n          understand.\n        </p>\n\n        <h1>Technology</h1>\n\n        <p>\n          I started this project using the Kivy framework for app development in\n          Python (I really like Python). Using Kivy I finished a Beta that was\n          usable on desktop, but Kivy deployment is whole different\n          story-deploying to iOS was very difficult for a few reasons, primarily\n          the lack of support for the new line of M1 Mac computers. With that, I\n          decided to migrate to Xcode and redo the app in Swift. That part is\n          still ongoing, but a testable Beta should be up within a couple weeks.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          For financial market data, I started with an{\" \"}\n          <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://iexcloud.io/\">\n            IEXCloud API\n          </a>\n          , using the{\" \"}\n          <a\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noreferrer\"\n            href=\"https://pypi.org/project/iexfinance/\"\n          >\n            iexfinance\n          </a>{\" \"}\n          Python module as a wrapper. This worked really well, except I later\n          realized that the API calls I would make were a little out of my price\n          range. With that, I moved to webscraping Yahoo Finance, which worked\n          like a charm. With the move to Swift, I will have to re-write this\n          part of project, but a solution that uses my Python code for\n          webscraping would be nice (and easier to port to Android later on) so\n          if you have suggestions, please <Link to={\"/contact\"}>email</Link> me!\n        </p>\n\n        <h1>Things I Learned</h1>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p>Basic iOS Development</p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>Working with HTTPS API requests</p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>Mobile UI Design</p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>Sometimes you have to know when to switch technologies!</p>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ProjectDetailView;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
